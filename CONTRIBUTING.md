# Contributing
We would love for you to contribute solutions this repository. There are a few guidelines:

* Make sure that your contributions are your own work. We are not responsible for any issues arising from the misuse of others work.
* Please respect the structure of the repository specified in the README.
* Pull requests must be substantial. Requests to merely change variable names or formatting will not be respected.
* Please follow existing code formatting.
* Please make sure that you have tested your program before submitting a pull request.
* Please ensure that commit messages are understandable at a glance, completely summarize the changes (using more lines than the first if neccesary) and that the first line is a description of the overall change (not the purpose, that should go in the description), is not capitalized, and does not end in a period.

We look forward to your help. Note that pull requests may not be viewed if the problem in question has not yet been solved by anyone on the reviewing staff (to prevent spoilers, of course).

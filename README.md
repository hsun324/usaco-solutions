# USACO Solutions
This repository contains various solutions to previous USACO competitions and training problems. Solutions here have met a subjective beauty  and elegance evaluation.

## Disclaimer
The point of USACO is to "[support] computing education in the USA and worldwide by identifying, motivating, and training high-school computing students at all levels." These solutions are intended for reflection and comparison only. If you have not yet solved a specific USACO problem on your own, please do not look at the solutions here. All the problems are possible, and with time and effort, everyone can solve them all.

These solutions all pass on USACO official graders; however, there is no guarantee that they will also work on your own computer and will take the same amount of time to run.

## Structure
All solutions to problems are stored within folders representing a certain problem. Within each problem are multiple subfolders in the format `<language>-<id>` where language is one of `c`, `cpp`, `cpp11`, `java`, `pascal`, `py`.

### Contest Problems
Individual contests are organized by year, month, and division in the format `<year>-<month>-<division>`. Within each competition, each problem is organized by its number and the name of the problem in the format `<number>-<name>` and the id an identifier for individual solutions unique within a specific language and problem.

### Training Problems
Solutions to problems on the USACO training subsite are located within `training`. These solutions are organized by both the chapter, section and lesson they reside in as well as by the problem name in the format `<chapter>-<section>-<lesson>-<name>`.

Some training sections may actually refer to the contest problem from where they originated.
